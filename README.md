# Image Convolution Visualizer
A user can upload an impage and specify the kernel (matrix) to use in the convolution.
## Motivation
I built this page to help see the effects and uses of convolution on images. Some examples are in order to detect edges or to sharpen an image. Convolution is used in CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) in order to analyze features within an image for object detection or other various applications.
## Getting Started
